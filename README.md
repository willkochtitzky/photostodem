# photostodem

These scripts should run a complete workflow in Metashape by reading in photos and a CSV file of coordinates and outputting orthomosaics and DEMs.

These scripts were written to run on Cedar with Compute Canada

The jupyter notebook is a script to marry a DEM and photo record collected for photogrammetry. It is currently written for a flight we ran in September, so needs to altered for any other case (each flight is unique).
